New Year's Eve, 2399, and Lagrange is celebrating centuries of relative peace. Life has been, by and large, good for those who chose to upload their consciousnesses. They mark milestones, fall in and out of love, dwell in peace. They fork, copying themselves for specific tasks or to go live separate lives. Memories pile up as they carry on.

And then everything grinds to a halt.

One year, one month, and eleven days have gone missing...and so has one percent of the population of Lagrange. 23 billion souls lost.

*Marsh* is a new novel in the Post-Self universe, following Reed and the rest of his cocladists, fellow instances forked from the original uploaded mind of Marsh, as they strive to discover what has happened and where Marsh has gone, rendering them unmoored: five unconnected instances with no root to connect them.

Includes stories by Samantha Yule Fireheart, Michael Miele, Caela Argent, Andréa C. Mason, Thomas "Faux" Steele, Nathan Mcardle-Mott-Merrifield, Sarah Bloden, and Krzsyztof "Tomash" Drewniak.
