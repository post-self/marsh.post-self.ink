Joanna sat at her kitchen table, having the hardest time figuring out the next best move to make while playing solitaire. The cards were jumbo print, of course, a leftover from her time phys-side. She was just about to move a column of cards using a king when she heard her doorbell. She could have created her sim so the default entrance was within her home, but she was old-fashioned. She liked having her guests wait a bit while she got around to answer the door. There was something to be said for indulging anticipation, especially on the System, where so many things were instantaneous. She swiped a wrinkled hand over the in-progress game and the cards fluttered away, stored in an exo-cortex to pick up later. She got up slowly and puttered her way over to the front door.

Arranging this get-together was a welcome distraction for her. When she received the confirmation message, she had trouble thinking of much else. Though she hadn't met her visitor yet, Joanna knew what she looked like. She looked out of the peephole to check it was her visitor before undoing the lock and opening up the door.

An older woman was standing on Joanna's front porch. She had a slight hunch to her back and was quite short so that Joanna had to look down slightly to make eye contact. She was wearing a striped shirt with comfortable slacks and her gray hair was done up in a perm tighter than any of the folds of her skin. She was clutching a small purse and looked expectantly at Joanna to make the first move.

"I trust you're Bethann then? Saw my ad in the feeds?" Joanna asked.

"Yes, yes. And you must be Joanna. I decided to come and see what this is about. I could also use a break after all the unpleasantness that's been going on."

"Well that is an understatement. Still, I am glad you made the trip out."

"Likewise. Now, can I come inside? The outside of your sim isn't exactly winning any awards."

Joanna held out her hand to help the woman climb up the final step into the house. Bethann pushed past her hand and stepped inside without another thought. The interior was cozy, if not a little dusty. There was a boxy T.V. set into an ornate wooden frame that sat on the floor facing the living room. The thought of moving it was impossible, it had been there long enough to begin fusing with the floorboards underneath it. The couch had an intricate floral pattern for a flower that Bethann was sure did not exist. Perhaps a take on an object'd'art from the Exchange? The coffee table, fittingly, had an abandoned cup of coffee sitting off to the side. The living room was small, barely enough room to step around the tables and furniture to move around. Bethann wondered to herself why Joanna had decided to make her sim so cramped. Before she could ask, Joanna said, "I'm glad you could take time out of your busy schedule to come over."

A blatant attempt to guilt Bethann over her re-scheduling their meeting. She let the comment slide off of her and responded with, "I would have arrived sooner, but I won't miss my shows. I've been getting invested in the newest reboot of Darkest Shadows. They've learned a lot from the last seven attempts that is making the show compelling to keep up with."

"I'm more partial to Bonanza myself, but I don't think the writers knew what to do with Hoss in the latest version being produced sys-side. I stopped watching when Little Joe forked into Medium Joe and Big Joe. That's just too much Joe for one show."

"Yes, it does sound like a lot. So where are we doing this? I don't think there's enough leg room for us to set up here."

Joanna puttered around Bethann, shuffling her feet on the worn carpet as she did so. She waved her hand for Bethann to follow her. "This way dear, we'll have more room in the kitchen."

Bethann walked over and sat down in one of the two chairs set up at the kitchen table. Much like everything else in the sim, it seemed tailor-made for Joanna's convenience first. The table was big enough to seat one extra guest and no more. Joanna arrived shortly after Bethann had set down her purse. If Bethann had noticed how Joanna had neglected to offer her a drink or snack before they were settled, she didn't say so.

"What game would you like to play first? Was there a favorite that your young gentleman would choose?"

Joanna laughed, "You get right to the point don't you? Reminds me of him in a way. But to answer your question, we would take turns in picking out the games we would play. Since you are my guest, I'll give you the first choice."

"That's mighty kind of you. I'm partial to boardgames, so I'll suggest something simple to start with. Have you ever played Uncle Wiggily?"

"I can't say that I have, but I'm willing to learn."

"If you'll grant me the proper ACL's, I can grab it out of the games I've brought with me."

Joanna looked up and away for a few seconds before saying, "There, you should have permission now."

Bethann reached her hands into her purse and pulled out a colorful box with a collection of anthropomorphic animals dressed in fancy clothes prancing about in an idyllic forest. The majority of the box art was taken up by the titular Uncle Wiggily, a dandy rabbit man with a black suit jacket, bright yellow shirt, red corduroy pants, blue bowtie, and a top hat that he had tipped to the side.

Bethann opened up the box and began unfolding the game board and setting out the player markers. "If you're at all familiar with Candy Land, it plays similarly. You draw cards from the deck and on each of the cards is a number that tells you how much you are to move. The catch is that there are poems on each of the cards and you must read out the poem before you are allowed to move."

"Every time? Wouldn't that get tiring?" Joanna asked.

"It's a part of the overall whimsy the game is trying to evoke. You are a dandy woodland animal having a merry time of skipping through the forest after all."

Bethann set the player pieces in front of Joanna, each a copy of Uncle Wiggily but with different colored suits in red, green, blue, and yellow. Joanna chose the blue piece and Bethann chose the green. They set their pieces on the starting square and took turns reading the cards and moving their pieces. As they settled into a rhythm of passing turns, they talked with each other.

"I'm deeply sorry for your loss. I've lost a lot of good friends in the New Year too," Bethann said.

"Thank you. It's been a terrible few days."

"What was your young gentleman's name?"

"His name was NaSRFS. I didn't know much about him, but he would come once a week to spend time with me. Didn't strike me as a tracker, more of a tasker really. That made his choice to visit a little more special. It's nice to know that he was willing to fork for our time together."

For a moment, Bethann's shoulders tensed at the mention of NaSRFS, and then it was gone. "That does sound nice. It's good for us old fogeys to socialize with younger instances. They keep us up to date on what's happening outside of our own sims in the System, do they not?"

It was a leading question, but Joanna was not taking the bait. After an uncomfortable silence had passed, Bethann placed her marker at the end of the winding path and said, "I guess that makes me the winner. Why don't you choose a game for us to play next?" She gathered up the pieces, shuffled the cards, and folded up the board in quick measure. Packing it away quickly and carefully.

"Oh, I know just the game. I'm more for card games, so I'll teach you how to play Clock."

"Never heard of it before."

"Then I'm glad I can be your introduction." Joanna pointed her hand down and flicked it quickly upwards. Through the motion, she had produced a standard deck of playing cards with the words JUMBO PRINT on the side in large bubble letters. She took out the cards, removed the jokers and rule card, and began shuffling the deck. As she shuffled, she explained the basics of the game.

"Clock is a lot like a cooperative variant of solitaire. You work together to play cards on the various positions around the 'clock' that is built around the deck. But it is a competitive game too, as each play gets both of you closer to playing out the cards in your hand and winning the game."

"Sounds delightful. How many cards do we get?"

"Five to start, but if you don't have a play, you draw until you have a playable card." Joanna stopped shuffling and dealt out the cards to herself and Bethann. She alternated giving each of them a card until they had a full hand of five. Then, she turned over four cards from the top of the deck to form a cross shape around the deck in the center.

"I'll go first," Joanna said, placing a black five on top of a red six.

Bethann played a red nine on a black ten and passed her turn. A few turns later, Joanna stopped her turn to say, "Aces are special, you play them on the corners and then can build on top of that suit. They provide a new set of plays to make on your turn and open up new strategies." She laid down her ace of hearts in the upper left corner, closest to Bethann. "You've been awfully quiet. Are you also thinking of someone you lost recently?"

Bethann grumbled and drew from the deck until she had a three she could play.

"Yes, a good many someones. Three long-lived instances of my own that I will miss, though they never called, so less so than others."

"I was lucky enough to keep all of my personal instances. I'm sorry to hear you have lost some of yours." She played a king and moved a column of cards onto another column.

"It's small potatoes in comparison to the rest of the System. But I guess everyone's hurting." Bethann played a queen on Joanna's king.

"I've reached out to my family, but they're reeling too."

"I really should do that. With everything happening, I didn't really consider it."

"That's surprising. Especially when you agreed to spend time with a stranger on such short notice. No other friends available?" Joanna was needling Bethann, trying to get her to crack.

"Much as I would love to tell you, it seems as though you've won." Bethann moved the six of hearts onto the five in the corner and waited expectantly.

Joanna swore under her breath. She played her last card, the seven of hearts, and said, "So I have. What are we playing next?"

"Phase 10 but with dice. I could do with throwing something right now."

Joanna tried to keep the insinuation that she had thrown their previous match deliberately out of her voice. "Sounds interesting, how do you play?"

"If you're familiar with Yahtzee, it's similar in a lot of ways. You roll all ten of your dice and then choose which you want to keep, re-rolling up to three times. Then you try to make hands with the numbers you rolled and we score after ten rounds."

Bethann brought out the game and they spent time talking about little things. Joanna mentioned her new favorite coffee brand she had found on the Exchange while Bethann complained of the gall of the newest uploads in their tone on the shared feeds. While they were both still listening intently, neither prodded the other for more information than was given. Before they knew it, ten rounds had passed.

Bethann tallied up their scores and said, "My, my. I seem to have won this one."

"I can't believe your third re-roll actually mattered in that final round."

"What can I say? Risk is necessary if you want to win."

"I've got my own game that has an element of risk."

"Oh? Do tell."

"It's called Steal-A-Bundle. You make pairs with the cards on the board and the cards in your hand, but your pile can be stolen out from under you if your opponent has the same card that is on top of your pile in their hand."

"Hmm, sounds like it could get tricky quickly. Well, go ahead and deal out the cards then."

Joanna shuffled her well-worn deck and placed four cards face up in the center of the table. She then dealt out four cards to each of them. They passed turns back and forth, each placing a card from their hand onto a card in the center and adding it to their pile. They were even with each other until Joanna had picked up a set of eight's. Bethann flashed her own eight from her hand and moved Joanna's bundle on top of her own.

"A shame, Joanna, truly. It seems you don't know how to manage risk after all."

Joanna's eyebrow twitched at that. Bethann had crossed a line with that implication. She placed the remaining eight from the deck on top of Bethann's bundle, pulling the cards into her own pile. "I know more than you can imagine. Like that you also had a standing game night with NaSFRS."

Bethann's eyes went wide. "How did you..."

But Joanna cut her off, "When I found out he was lost, I did some digging. And I can never just leave well-enough alone. I think you did much the same as me. I respect you enough to think that you weren't completely unaware of the way I worded my ad on the feed. It was set to run in your most heavily trafficked areas after all. Let's cut the shit for a second."

Bethann let herself relax and the tone of her voice was icy, calculated. "You should know that I forked just for this meeting. If you're carrying out some grand plot, you're not going to take me out here."

Joanna scoffed and said, "We've just met, I don't expect you to have a CPV built out for me. And I don't have one for you, if you are worried about that. That comes later once we get to know each other better."

"Then what, exactly, are you driving at?"

Joanna leaned across the table and got in Bethann's face as she whispered, "He got us to drop our guard. Both of us."

"Yes, that is troubling. But whatever he knew has left with him. Shouldn't that be a comfort?" Bethann asked.

Joanna's face pulled down into a deep frown. "We know a lot of dangerous secrets."

Bethann waved a hand through the air, dismissing her concerns. "Oh sure, bunches. But that doesn't make it easier to lose him."

Joanna leaned back, which caused the wooden chair to creak slightly. "How can you be certain he wasn't just using us to get intel?"

"I can't be sure, but we used him too. Admit it. Wasn't it good to have someone to play games with that would give a damn?"

Joanna's frown eased back off into a tired smile. "Yes, it was. He knew how to keep things interesting."

"If it helps, I miss him terribly as well."

"Strangely, it does." Joanna straightened up and asked, "Now what are we playing next?"

"I'd like to kick this up a notch. Try something a bit more complicated. Have you ever played Othello before?"

"Hmm, not particularly. Are you sure you don't want to play chess?"

"No, no. I find it to be too cliche. And we're playing friendly games, correct? I have a bit of a mean streak with chess."

"Othello it is then."

Joanna cleared the table with a thought, the playing cards sliding effortlessly back into their box. Bethann dug around in her purse until she found a small bright green board that folded in the middle. She unclasped a hinge on the side and opened the board up. Inside of the board were two trays, each filled with shiny round plastic tiles that had white on one side and black on the other. She set one of these trays in front of Joanna and the other in front of herself. She then took four tiles and put them in the middle of the board in a cube in the pattern of white-black-black-white.

Bethann explained the rules of Othello in painstaking detail. She spent so long on the rules that Joanna wondered if they were going to have time to actually play the game. She interrupted Bethann's explanation of the importance of taking the corners by saying, "Seems straightforward to me. I think I can pick up the rest as we play."

Bethann shrugged her shoulders and motioned to the two colors. "Now, which color would you like?" Bethann asked.

"How generous of you to give me first pick. I'd like the white tile please."

"Then I will go first as black."

She picked up a tile and placed it on the board so that the white tile was between her two black ones. She then flipped the white tile over and made the whole line black. Joanna thought for a moment before deciding on where she wanted to place her tile. She reached hesitantly across the board and placed her white tile, flipping the black pieces to white. They passed a few more turns before Joanna started to feel the pressure the game had to offer.

Joanna's forehead wrinkles were scrunched up as she concentrated on the board. "You don't give an inch, do ya?" She placed a white tile and could only flip over two.

Bethann placed her tile, flipping five white to black and said, "I've no patience for people who coddle when competing. Oh, it's important to explain the rules. And you daresn't leave out any details or gain the upper hand by withholding at the start. But once you are playing a game, then you are on your own. For is it not the act of playing that teaches us the most? How can there be sweetness in eventual victory without having been defeated? Loss can be an excellent teacher, if you let it."

Joanna placed her white tile and methodically flipped over row after column of black tiles until the majority of the board was covered in white. "And what has this loss taught you?"

Bethann grimaced down at the board on the table. "That I need to be more careful with how I place my pieces. But the game is not over yet." She tapped her container of tiles to emphasize the fact the game was just starting.

"No, not this. I meant *the loss.* The one that everyone on the System is working through."

Bethann thought for a while and placed her tile on a corner. While it only gave her four tiles, she was using it to gain a future foothold. She replied tiredly, "That we are not as immortal as we like to believe. It is easy to forget the fragility of our shared dream. And living much longer lives has shifted our collective perspective."

"Do you think that we'll be able to heal, without being able to forget?" She placed a tile that gave her a full row of white.

"I think it's possible, yes. But again, the scale of time for that healing to occur is elongated. To help my case, I'd like to share something about NaSRFS that I discovered while mourning. He was only 120 years old. Can you believe that?" She claimed a full column of black.

Joanna gasped and said, "He was just a baby! Barely over a century old and gone already. Too soon, much too soon." Two diagonal lines of white flipped onto the board.

"You see my point though. Phys-side, 120 is an incredibly long life, but here you're just getting to the good stuff. I don't think everyone is as worried about losing an entire year as someone phys-side would be coming out of a coma. Because to us, a year is a drop in a bucket of time. Inconvenient, yes, but devastating, no. It is the loss of the promised years of those that disappeared that weighs heavy on us. The collective potential of billions of immortals snuffed out that has us weary to our bones."

Bethann placed her last black tile, but it could only flip over one tile. She could tell Joanna was going to win a few turns ago. When Joanna placed her last tile, she didn't even flip over the tiles. Instead, Bethann flipped them for her as she talked.

"I suppose I could see that. If I'm being honest, I had a similar reaction recently. The day after New Years, I realized that I hadn't turned off my reminder for NaSRFS coming over to play cards. When I got the notification ping, it took me a moment to realize that he wasn't coming. Then that dovetailed into thinking about all of the other weeks left in the year where I would not see him and I felt myself a fool. Both for forgetting to turn off the alert and for grieving time that was not spent."

Joanna looked to be on the verge of tears. Bethann reached out a hand across the table to comfort her, patting her hand gently. Joanna let the moment last for a second and no longer, immediately pulling her hand back towards her pack of cards. She was upset at the fact that Bethann had managed to get her to let her guard down and show her sadness. The last person to manage that had played her. Composure regained and wobble gone from her voice, she said, "One more game. And this time, I get to choose my favorite."

It was a dare. An invitation to dance along the edge of their shared grief at their limit. To play a host's favorite game in their own house was incredibly dangerous.

Bethann steepled her fingers and breathed out through her nose slowly. "I do hope I don't regret this, Joanna. But I'll bite, what game are we playing?"

"Texas hold 'em poker.''

A small smile at the corners of Bethann's mouth. "It's hardly interesting without a proper wager."

Joanna shrugged and said, "I suppose you have a point. Whoever wins the round, gets to ask one question. No stipulations or affordances made or given. If you know the answer, you must talk."

Bethann nodded, "Agreeable. Deal out the hand."

"You know how to play then?"

"Everyone knows poker, Joanna. Let's face each other properly."

Bethann waved her hand through the air towards the middle of the table, Othello board and pieces vanishing into mist. Her bag lurched to life and coughed out a large pile of multicolored poker chips. With a quirk of her eyebrow and a twitch of her eye, the pile was divided neatly in half. Joanna let the cards fly from the open box to settle in front of them, two face down each. The only sound in the room was the steady ticking of the novelty cuckoo clock on the wall. Each woman peeked at her hand as though it held the secret to the universe. And then, the game began.

"Ante."

"Call. Playing the flop."

"Bet."

"Raise."

"Call."

"Playing the turn."

Bethann scowled, "Fold."

Joanna scooped the wagered chips into her pile. She gathered the cards up with her hands, shuffled them, and offered the deck to Bethann to cut. She tapped the top, declining the offer. Joanna dexterously dealt the cards out to both of them.

"Ante."

"Call. Playing the flop."

"Bet."

"Call. Playing the turn."

"Check."

"Check. Playing the river."

"Bet."

Joanna shook her head and said, "Fold."

Bethann snatched the chips in the wagered pile and let them slip through her fingers and clink musically into her personal stash.

Joanna gathered the cards and handed the pile to Bethann. "You'll deal." It was not a question, but a command. Bethann did not refuse. She bridge shuffled the cards together a few times and then offered the deck to Joanna to cut, which she did.

They were all business. Only speaking when taking game actions. Each blink of the eyes told a new and complex story. A flick of a card on the outside of the flop before the turn was enough to raise and force a fold. Or the sniffle of a nose was a false tell meant to throw the opponent. Hands kept only on the feeling that the tapping of a foot was excitement and not nerves. The myriad invisible ways in which they both could not help but to give their hands away. Everything that they had learned from each other in the last few hours was put to ruthless, efficient use.

Bethann started the round, hoping to force Joanna to bet all her chips, "Ante."

"Call."

"Playing the flop." She dealt out three cards; two of diamonds, jack of spades, and five of hearts. Joanna itched the back of her leg with her foot. Bethann hesitated for a second before removing her fingers from the five of hearts.

"Check."

"Check. Playing the turn." Bethann dealt out the next card, nine of diamonds, and took an opportunity to peek at her two face down cards. She noticed that Joanna's eyes had lost some of their edge. Only a sliver, but enough to catch.

"Bet." Joanna tossed her chips high in the air and let them hit the middle pile one at a time. She was teasing Bethann. She wouldn't have it.

"Raise." Her betting was serious and succinct. She used the back of her right hand to push the required chips into the pile. She kept eye contact with Joanna as she moved them.

"Call." Joanna clicked her tongue on the roof of her mouth and the chips needed appeared on top of the betting pile. She only had a few chips left.

"Playing the river." Bethann turned over the final card, a 2 of clubs.

"Check."

"No all-in Joanna? Where's your sense of adventure?"

"I have my own cliches I'm opposed to. Ready to reveal?"

"Let's see what you have."

The two players flipped over their face down cards and they each announced their poker hand in turn.

"Two pair," Joanna said. She had a jack of hearts and a nine of spades.

"Three of a kind." Bethann had revealed a seven of hearts and a two of spades. A hand just good enough to beat out Joanna's. She slumped back into her chair a little, letting the tension from her body relax. Joanna sat and stared at the poker hands for a while, letting the silence stretch on. She broke it by pushing the poker chips from the center over into Bethann's pile.

Bethann did her best to sit straight up again and said, "You don't have enough chips to make the ante, Joanna. I've won. Now it's your turn to spill."

Joanna tapped the kitchen table rhythmically with her pointer finger, a frown deeping on her face. "Go ahead and ask it then."

"What actually happened on New Year's?"

Joanna sighed and said, "I don't know."

Bethann reached for her purse, a scowl had crawled onto her face. "If you won't play by the rules you set your..."

But Joanna cut her off. "I'm not asking you to believe me! I don't know. Half of my network is gone and the other half are scrambling for answers. The information lockdown is tighter than it's ever been. Whatever happened is so important, they've shut down my usual avenues for sniffing it out. Not to mention the emotional state everyone's been in. You try retaining a system log dump file that's trillions of lines long while the agent who brought it to you breaks down into tears on line 555,678,901 because their best friend died and they didn't know!"

Bethann let go of her purse and her expression softened. She could see how frazzled Joanna was from how tightly she clutched her fist. Her eyes, endlessly tired and yet still intense and sharp, dared Bethann to question her testimony. But Bethann knew she was telling the truth.

"Thank goodness it's not just me. I've personally got twenty-four forks scouring the System for leads and haven't come up with anything substantial. I thought I was losing my touch."

Joanna laughed and said hoarsely, "I've got fifty-two working overtime right now. The merging has been a bit much to keep up with, but it sounds like they're bringing out the big players for this."

"Council of Eight nonsense?"

"Most assuredly."

"Ah, well then. Nothing a change in tactics can't fix right?"

"Beats moping around all day for sure. Need to use all this restless energy somehow."

Bethann stood up from her seat and said, "This was fun. I didn't realize how much I needed it. I think I'd like to come over again. Perhaps without the spycraft next time."

"Oh, come now Bethann. You know that's what makes it fun. Besides, I think that's what he would have wanted."

"Same time next week then?"

"No, I wasn't born yesterday. You'll know I'm game from this series of sensorium pings."

Joanna sent over a quick succession of five sensorium pings and watched Bethann's expression turn to one of manic glee.

"That works for me. Have a lovely night Joanna."

"You as well, Bethann."

And with that, Bethann stepped from the sim back to her own home. Joanna willed the sim to dim the lights. She puttered back to sit at the kitchen table and brought out the solitaire game once more. After carefully considering her options, she decided to not move the column with the king after all. Instead, she placed a red queen on top of it and drew a new card. She smiled brightly down at the board and her hand as everything started to fall into place.
